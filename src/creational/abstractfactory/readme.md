Now, to implement this new requirement, after using Factory method we will use a factory of factories i.e. an Abstract Factory.
The Abstract Factory (A.K.A. Kit) is a design pattern which provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent
objects without specifying their concrete classes. The Abstract Factory pattern takes the concept of the Factory Method Pattern
to the next level. An abstract factory is a class that provides an interface to produce a family of objects. In Java, it can be
implemented using an interface or an abstract class.
